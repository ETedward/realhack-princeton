I’m totally sure which angle you’re asking the question from, so I’ll answer both ways. So if you’re a prefrosh who (like I was), is worried that everyone here is really weird and only wants to study all the time, that is definitely not the case at all. I actually really really appreciate the fact that I’m able to have very serious, intellectual conversations and go out and have a lot of fun with the same people. Everyone here is smart and talented and passionate about something, which is super refreshing and awesome, but most people are still at least somewhat social. Not everyone is a party animal, but most people are at least nice and approachable. I guess if you think about it, everyone here had to get through an alumni interview, so if someone was really really weird, they probably would have had a hard time with that. If you are looking to find a culture of “nerds” to join, I don’t think you would have a hard time with that either. There are people here who study a lot or play video games, and there are also people who don’t. You will find people who are like you in that regard. I guess what I’m trying to say is that everyone here is probably a nerd at heart, but I wouldn’t say there’s an overwhelmingly pervasive “nerd culture”. You can easily find people that you’re comfortable with, whether they’re nerds or the opposite (but I would say that most people are somewhere in the middle).

I'm vegetarian too and sometimes I feel like there's not many options for me (at least not healthy options)", "Response from Princess Mia:\n\nHey, fellow vegetarian! I felt that way a lot my freshman year, so it definitely took awhile for me to figure out how to eat right. I’m actually trying to go vegan at the moment, but it’s proving to be way harder than I thought haha. This is going to be one of my classic really long posts, just a warning, but my number one tip to you is to check out the menus online or on the new app TigerMenus before picking a dining hall. That way, you’ll have a good idea of if there is something you can eat before going for a meal. Also, in my experience, Forbes and Roma sometimes have the best vegetarian entrees, but Butler has the best options. I’m going to write out what I like to eat in all the dining halls! * is something they have most days or every day. \n\nWucox: Pasta Bar* (pro tip- if you bring a plate to the salad bar, you can put veggies or tofu on it and bring it over to the pasta station, and they’ll add those! you can also ask for only one or two scoops of pasta to prevent it from being too carby and less broth or sauce if you’re concerned about oil. definitely add chickpeas or quinoa for protein!), Salad from the salad bar, usually with brown rice on the side*, Taco salad* (they’ve been having an enchilada bar a lot of the time now, so I’ll start a plate with romaine lettuce, and then add veggies and beans and brown rice with guac and mango salsa), minestrone soup, tortilla soup. My favorite entrees- seitan stew, chickpea dishes (they have several that are very good), stuffed peppers, penne with roasted tomatoes. Another pro tip- you can make yourself a quesadilla* if you take a tortilla from the sandwich station, fold it and add cheese, and then put it in the panini press! Then you can add salsa or guac from the enchilada bar. \n\nRoMa: Indian food every Saturday dinner* (the paneer is amazing), pierogis, vegetable lo mein, seitan and potato soup, vegetable pot pie, mac and cheese, cheese and potato soup, cheese/roasted veggies/fancy bread bar*, fancy pasta*, fancy grilled cheese with tomato from action station*, spaghetti squash, salads* in those nice new bowls!\n\nWhitman: Jamaican jerk chickpeas, vegetable pot pie, bean dishes, spaghetti squash, salad with egg and apple* (I don’t eat here much at all; sorry)\n\nForbes: Okay, every once in a while, they have a special vegetarian/earth-friendly day, where everything offered is vegetarian! That’s probably my favorite food night ever, as it has so many incredible and locally sourced options, like fried avocado flatbread and butternut squash mac and cheese. Otherwise, they usually have very solid veg entrees, like a lot of seitan and bean dishes. Some favorites- kale ceasar salad*, brunch mac and cheese with egg and avocado*, seitan and cauliflower, vegetable chili, alfredo pasta.\n\nCJL: I’ve only eaten here a few times, but it seems like they have really great options! \n\nHope this helps! :)))  "], ["March 30, 2017 at 8:55 am", "ok am i the only one who finds myself constantly doing work at 5am and barely sleeping the entire week just because I have so much stuff to do", "Response from Nick Carraway:\n\nI personally have never found myself in a position where I needed to stay up later than 2am. I’m sure you’re not the only one feeling overwhelmed like this, though. Are you using your time during the day as efficiently as you could? When you’re studying, are you studying effectively or are you distracted? What classes are you taking? Is it an unusually hard 5-class semester, or is this a norm for you? Just some questions to ask yourself.\n\nPerhaps meet with a learning consultant from McGraw to discuss study strategies and ways to make the workload seem more manageable. \n\nResponse from Pablo:\n\nI totally feel you, anon. There are just not enough hours in the day! I’m not sure your current schedule is sustainable because going to sleep that late can be very damaging and I think Nick has some really good tips if you’re talking about academic work. Maybe programs like HUM and ISC require such commitment (lmk), but you definitely want to think about whether you’re using time effectively. For example, if you’re constantly staying up late doing a ton of readings, you may want to look into reading a little differently. You may also want to think about how to better build your academic schedule - this semester I essentially have a four day weekend and it’s lovely.\n\nOn the other hand, if activities/work/non-academic stuff are causing you to work later than usual, I can relate and I can assure you that you’re not alone. One of my friends had rehearsal until 12:30 AM the other day and couldn’t begin working until after. A few of my friends are in Hell Week right now (as performers) and are facing that same struggle. I know some people on the Honor Committee or Committee on Discipline who have huge chunks of their time taken up by hearings. And when clubs plan large-scale events, the logistical tedium can be so time consuming. I think there are definitely a good number of Princeton students that tend to overbook themselves, myself included, and that also translates to staying up later than is optimal.\n\nStill, the above examples are more on the temporary side. If you’re constantly working until 5 AM because non-academic work takes up most of your day, then you may need to ask yourself some questions that I know I consistently ask myself. Are you happy in each of your non-academic activities? Would it be possible to take a step back? Realize that these activities, as fun as they are, do need to come second to your studies.\n\nI’ll finish by adding that the worst part of this whole thing, whether it’s academic work or non-academic work that is taking up your time, is normalizing this kind of behavior. After doing it for a few times, you may feel as though it has to be routine, but it doesn’t! I know now that, when I start feeling tired, I won’t be able to get much out of more work, so I go to bed and try to finish up the next day. Listen to your body - you’ll probably feel a lot better if you do.\n\nAnyways, feel free to give us more info as to what is taking up so much of your time!

Could an open relationship work while we try to be together as much as possible? How do people view open relationships? Thanks haha!", "Response from Princess Mia:\n\nI haven’t, but two of my best friends from high school have experience with LDRs, so I’ve basically heard about all their problems with it. Hope this will help! In my opinion, the most important thing is to make sure that the two of you are on the same page. You need to make sure that you and your boyfriend have the same expectations of the relationship. \n\nThis can mean a few different things. I think one of the main things in an LDR is to strike a balance between your relationship and your college life. If it gets too overbearing, it can really detract from your other commitments and relationships. One of my friends ended up breaking up with her boyfriend because of this. They had a very serious relationship, but he just had super high expectations, and wanted to be talking to her all the time. He would text or DM or snapchat her literally all day and respect constant responses, and then would also want to FaceTime with her for several hours at night. At some point, she realized that that was detracting from her social and professional life at school, and once they broke up, she felt relieved of that commitment. But again, the same can be said of the opposite. My other friend literally hardly ever talked to her boyfriend, and at some point, she started to question why they were in a relationship at all! \n\nI think the same thing can be said with the open relationship thing. Situations like that can very easily get messy. You need to really realize how you feel and communicate that to your boyfriend. It’s a really difficult situation if, for example, you say that you’re okay with him hooking up with other girls (or boys!) but then feeling betrayed or angry if he does. Feeling that way is totally understandable, but it’s important to recognize that feeling and decide if the open relationship will actually work. \n\nI will say this- if you really care about each other and are honest and communicate well, then you can make it work. My roommate is in probably the cutest LDR ever, and both of my friends had some great times with their LDR boyfriends. Some things that worked well for my friends- making semi-regular (maybe once or twice per semester and on breaks) to visit each other, being thoughtful and remembering the important things that are going on in their lives (one of my friends had an important final, and her boyfriend sent her flowers for it, but even just talking or calling is really vital), communicating when things aren’t working, sharing your lives with each other, etc. Good luck!!  "], ["March 29, 2017 at 12:49 am", "@pichu, your roommate who's a PAA, do you know if those 2 meal swipes are only for his specific res college (as in the res college he's a PAA for) dining hall or can be used in any dining hall?", "Response from Princess Mia:\n\nSorry to hijack from Pichu lol!

Honestly having a good set of friendships is in many ways more valuable than having a romantic partner; having a handful of people you can turn to and who understand the different parts of your life is really special. Try to actively appreciate and enjoy the time you spend with your friends and to invite them to events and stuff.\n\nResponse from Anything Clever ‘17:\n\nLoneliness is completely natural, especially in the spring when schedules get packed, people are busier, and tensions are higher. That being said, it sounds like there are two possible issues here: one is that your friends are starting relationships while you are not, and new relationships are a time suck, so you may be seeing them less. If that’s the case, be open with your friends - tell them you miss them, that you’ve been feeling down, ask for a friend night. Quality time with those you care about on this campus might help. On the other hand, the issue may be that you do want a relationship, whether or not you have the time for it. You might want to take the time to think about whether you’re open to meeting someone romantically or not rather than just excluding the possibility due to time. Finally, emotional “weirdness”, as normal as it may be on Princeton’s campus, is still exhausting and difficult to deal with. I always think it’s worth trying to see CPS - worst case it’s unhelpful and you lost one hour trying to improve your well being (which is never a waste of time) and best case they get you on track to understand and address your emotions better. Regardless, try taking quality time with YOURSELF, whether that means watching your favorite tv show/movie, exercising, reading a book - whatever makes you feel good.

I like to think of procrastination as something that just naturally happens if you put yourself in the environment where it’s possible. In other words, you have some level of control over it. The most common methods of procrastination, I would say, are sleep (if you work in your room/on your bed, so just don’t do that), long meals, wasting time on the phone or internet, and doing other things to avoid the main project you need to work on. \n\n\nFirst, something that was revolutionary for me when I was trying to eliminate distractions and enhance focus to decrease procrastination was learning to limit my access to unnecessary online sites and to my phone. To do this, I have started using this app called SelfControl, which lets you put in sites to block and how much time you want to not be able to access them. For me, that list includes netflix and facebook, but also nytimes, allrecipes, reddit - basically any site I find myself perusing randomly. As for my phone, I either leave it on do not disturb, or what’s better, I leave it in another room or in a different part of the room I’m in, so I have to actively go out of my way to access it. This way, I can consciously stop myself or at least feel bad if I use it, which will motivate me to limit that.\n\nAs for long meals, this usually happens when you eat in a big dhall where you know a lot of people. What might help here is working on a different side of campus (in a classroom or in the library - anywhere where you can limit distractions as much as possible, ie not a dhall or public area like Frist) and then going to a dhall that you go to less frequently.

The one thing is that it can oftentimes take a while to get an initial appointment. However, in my case my situation was urgent and so I scheduled an appointment the day of and got to see someone that day which was really helpful.

If we went through with it, do you think it's a really bad idea considering that things might get awkward and Princeton's so small?", "Response from Ziggy:\n\nIt can really go both ways. If you want to keep it totally casual, you should (a) know and be okay with the fact that there’s no such thing as truly “no strings attached,” especially when you’re friends, and (b) be prepared for the high chance that at least something will change in your dynamic. With respect to (a), I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing, but don’t be surprised if your feelings are confusing, if there’s an emotional aspect since you’re already friends, etc. With respect to (b), you just have to both be really in-tune with yourselves and how you approach sex, and you have to be prepared for any consequences that do occur.\n\nSo… I think it’s less black-and-white than a “bad or good idea.”\n\nEDIT: and with respect to the small community thing, it was just something I mentioned yesterday because the Princeton rumor mill is vicious and people are petty and immature af here. If you run into an ex-hookup, sure it can be a lil awkward, but as long as you’re both acting like adults it won’t be a big deal at all.\n\nResponse from Anything Clever ‘17:\n\nI think the most important advice I could give you here is to talk frankly with this person. Having the ‘casual’/expectations talk isn’t super sexy or spontaneous, I know, but chances are if you’re not comfortable having that conversation with this person, things WILL eventually get awkward and uncomfortable because you guys aren’t open enough with each other to communicate honestly. Also, having that discussion is likely to head off much worse conversations later on. Now, assuming you’ve had that conversation and everyone is on the same page, it’s really up to you. Do you think this is someone that you could still be chill with after having casual sex for a while? If not, is the friendship low-stakes enough that it would be worth the potential awkwardness later? Just clarify those things for yourself first, and then clarify with her: is she interested? Is she cool with it just being casual? And make sure you discuss other sexual partners because STDs are real, especially on college campuses.\n\nResponse from Sigmund Floyd ‘16:\n\nI’d also add that you should consider mutual friends and how they might feel about this, especially if it were to make it awkward for you two down the line. You might make it harder to interact with those mutual friends when both of you are present. I second the idea that you should have the conversation earlier rather than later, because things would just get increasingly more complicated and difficult to discuss later. It’s also important to think about whether moving in this direction might make either of you start considering something more serious in the future, and whether or not you would want that. It’s easy to just say it’s casual, but it often becomes more than that and can make for unbalanced expectations and desires, which would really sour the entire “casual hookup” dynamic. Good luck with the conversation!\n\nResponse from Ziggy:\n\nHmmm I agree that mutual friends are a factor to consider, but only up to a point. You’re two consenting adults thinking about having sex for yourselves. How your friends feel about it is totally secondary. It would be completely immature and objectively strange of them to suddenly have a problem hanging out with both of you at the same time just because you’ve had sex.\n\nRe-response from Sigmund Floyd:\n\nSorry for the confusion; my point was more about the potential fallout than during the hookup-phase. I speak from experience when I say that people can “pick sides” if things get awkward between two members of a friend group, and it can really strain the whole dynamic. I agree that when starting out, it should be a secondary concern, but I maintain that that does not mean that it is irrelevant. Also, it would not necessarily be strange for someone to feel uncomfortable if two of his/her friends start to become involved, especially if it’s a small group. Like, if three people are friends and two of them start a physical relationship, the third can start to feel like a third wheel. At this point, if the person making the decision about bringing up the topic is already trying to consider how it might affect his/her relationship with the other person, they would probably want to consider how it might hurt their other friendships.

I was a little nervous about quads and stuff coming into Princeton, because the quads and triples that I had seen before coming here were basically three our four sets of furniture jammed in one room. However, here I think the living situations are designed very nicely to allow for some separation. Most quads are made up of a common room and at least two bedrooms, and possibly a bathroom depending on your res college. Triples are typically at least two or three rooms, and doubles can be one or two rooms.\n\nI think the quad situation is nice because it gives you a set of people to hang out with right out of the gate, and the common room is really nice for inviting people over and just hanging out. Roommates can also be a nice support system if you’re away from home for the first time. I find it great to have people around to zip up my dress or rant to about my stupid life problems. However, if you know you are someone who has trouble getting along with people for extended periods of time, I would probably caution against it, because it can lead to more trouble than it’s worth. I guess the other negative simply comes with living people- you’ll have to accommodate other people’s schedules and needs.

I know it sounds cliche, but it’s honestly true. I have friends who have slept with 20+ people and friends who haven’t slept with anyone, and I don’t have any right to judge either one. Your sex life is a personal decision, and you reserve the right to say yes or no whenever you damn well please. \n\nFor me personally (maybe not you or everyone reading this blog), I think I generally try to be careful about doing things when either I or the other person is too drunk. I’ve had some really sloppy drunk DFMOs which is whatever, but I would not say it’s the most recommendable way to hook up with someone. There’s also an important consent issue with alcohol, so just be careful. I also personally would not sleep with somebody random or somebody that I brought home from the Street (again, if that’s your thing, you do you), and have a few friends who have gotten in sticky situations or regretted doing that. In terms of a good time to start (lol love the way that’s phrased), again that should be whatever you feel comfortable with!\n\nAnyways; TLDR- you do you, be safe and have fun! Bateman also says that this is “classic mia tmi” but whatever hope this helps!  \n\nResponse from Ziggy:\n\nI agree with everything Mia said and want to add that when you come to college, you tend to vastly overestimate how big this community is. If you do decide to play the field, more power to you, have fun, be safe, etc. etc. Just make sure you’re comfortable running into past hookups all the time.\n\nAlso, make a McCosh appointment after every new partner. It’s only, like, $14 for a full screening. Small price to pay for the potential benefits, IMO. Sex can have fuckin serious consequences, and you shouldn’t leave your health up to the honesty and health of someone else.\n\nAnd for god’s sake pls always use protection if it’s not monogamous.

I would say that coming from pton, the rigor of your courses won’t be doubted, but you still need to fulfill the pre-med requirements and take the MCAT. Your grades and numbers there, as well as your rec letters and how substantial your thesis is, are indicators of your course rigor and academic competence. \n\nHPA has a very interesting document that lists where people in each of the most common pre-med majors/divisions were accepted, and you can see from that that a typically pre-med major like MOL isn’t required or even guaranteed to get you anything. Personally, I think it’s MUCH more important to pursue what you are interested in, not only because you’d be more motivated to do the related work and excel in it, but because it makes you unique and in this case, would also allow you to pursue two other programs that could provide you with additional sets of knowledge and skills that you can use in your future career. \n\nThis goes for your activities outside of your academics as well, and it is especially important when it comes to interviews, when you’ll be asked about your activities and motivations, and I would say that it’s really obvious when you’ve done something to check a box rather than because you were personally interested in it. People are also more interested in hearing about the less traditional aspects of your path than what everyone else has done, especially if you can tie it back to medicine in some way.

Especially if you have A.P. credit, it means that students can really pursue a lot of other intellectual interests. I really enjoy most of my courses and one of the best aspects of the classwork is that it forces you to really problem solve and consider everything you’ve ever learned in the subject material. We’re always building upon previous work and examining relationships between everything in order to deepen our understanding. Another thing which is special, is our faculty. Forget all the Nobel Prize BS for a moment Our lecturers and professors really want to be here and love teaching undergraduates. They are extremely knowledgeable and more importantly they know how to explain in-depth and complicated theories to students (mostly). They could easily be working in government or the private sector, but they chose us instead. More importantly, I think ECO is the most politically and intellectually diverse department on campus. We have professors from all political viewpoints and it’s very refreshing compared to other classes. We get to hear arguments from both sides and in the end we make up our minds. This is why we have both socialist and libertarian students in this department! \n\nThat being said, I do think some stuff is annoying such as the senior comprehensive exam and a lot of the lower level classes are filled with too many students. Also, the core classes can be aggravating l like 310 or Econometrics, which are often poorly taught, boring, and worst of all, unhelpful.\n\nMy advice to a prospective major is to choose ECO because you are intrigued by its methodology and way of thinking. You enjoy theory and are also very comfortable in math (at Princeton we only have two choices: math or slightly less math compared to other places where Multi isn’t even required). DO NOT choose ECO because it’s the most popular major and you want to land a Wall Street job. \n\nOnce you’ve settled on ECO, I would recommend using AP credit if you feel that you have a very good grasp on the content. For sure, use AP Stats and Calc if you have it. Don’t let intro and core classes be the example of the major. Make sure you put yourself out there and don’t be afraid to approach professors and talk to them. Also ask for help when you need it. This is a big department and it can be easy to get lost and get anxious because nobody is going to be checking up on you all the time compared to… a language course or something like that. "], ["March 25, 2017 at 12:00 pm", "I don't know if I'll even have this choice, but would you recommend a larger single in an ok building such as 1903 or a smaller single in nicer building such as Dod?", "Response from Pablo:\n\nFor me, personally, location would beat out any other factor.

Maybe took me 7 minutes to pack my lunch and max of 20 to make dinner? I also eat very simply over the summer, though. For lunches I packed a ham sandwich, an apple, and a bag of pretzels or chips of some kind every day. For dinners, I alternated between scrambled eggs, pizza bagels, ham sandwiches, simple pasta with marinara sauce, grilled cheese, and eating out. Literally this is all I cooked. I also had bagels and cream cheese and cereal which I sometimes ate if I didn’t feel like walking to the kitchen to make something.

I mostly made dishes like stir fry, fried rice, “fancy” ramen, and curry. My culinary innovation this summer was realizing that rice + vegetable + tofu/egg drizzled in soy sauce and sesame oil is super tasty, fast, and cheap, and also hits the major food groups. I cooked with my boyfriend and we made 4 meals every dinner (one dinner and one lunch for each of us).\n\n\nOverall it was pretty enjoyable. If the kitchen wasn’t too crowded, we would play music or stream a TV show while cooking. We also often cooked in a larger group with a few other friends, which was fun.

One room is 140 sq feet per person, and the other is 160 sq feet per person, so I guess there’s a tangible change there. However, in my opinion, that’s not enough to justify certain other factors. For example, I’d take the smaller of the two if it were in a hallway with my friends, or if the 320 sq ft room was on the 4th floor with no elevator.

So I was on campus the summer after my freshman year, and I’m going to be on campus again this summer for my thesis research! Princeton offers on-campus housing for students for about $200/week (it’s actually like $190 if I remember correctly, it worked out to about 1900 for my 10 week program freshman summer). They usually have 3 buildings open for students to live in (Pyne, either Bloomberg or Scully, and I think 1903 were the 3 open my freshman year). There’s a separate room draw for this that starts around April 1st. You’ll probably get an email about it. There are kitchens in all of the buildings that students live in over the summer, so I’m planning to cook for myself. The meal plan on campus is hella expensive and not worth it in my opinion. If you’re doing research for a prof, you should ask if they have any extra funds or grant money floating around that you might be able to use to cover the cost of housing. I ended up getting a $4000 stipend through the neuroscience department my freshman summer, then on top of that I got $2000 from the NSF through my prof directly to cover housing. This way you can actually pocket your full stipend if it works out like it did for me! So that’s the housing/food situation. I’d say the majority of students cook for themselves. It gets super busy in the kitchens around dinner time every night. I usually went to the gym from like 5-8 so that I wouldn’t need to cook until 9 (then the kitchen was quieter). ALSO it gets fucking hot in Pyne over the summer (no AC kill me). Especially if you ever sleep with anyone… I had 2 heavy duty fans in my room that I pointed directly at me while I was sleeping. This made it bearable. Also try to get into Scully/Bloomberg (AC in there).\n\nIt is very peaceful on campus. I literally loved my summer freshman year. There’s only a few hundred kids on campus, everything’s quiet, the gym isn’t crowded, everything is perfect honestly.

But my freshman summer I didn’t really know anyone on campus, so I didn’t really hang out with people too much except like in lab. I was hooking up with someone all summer so he came over a lot lol. I’d say that not many people just spontaneously hang out. I was training for a half ironman triathlon so I ended up spending almost all of my free evening time at the gym. I was in lab like 9am-at least 5pm every night so that kept me busy. I also worked in a library over the weekend to make some extra money (would recommend this as well).

In my opinion, 20 extra square feet isn’t enough of a difference to choose a double over a single. Plus, Dod is wayyyyyy more centrally located.

Dod and scully basically have the same amenities (except scully has AC and Dod doesn’t), just the location for Dod is way betta. If you care a lot about size then i don’t think like ~20 square feet is worth it, places like patton and 1903 have huge singles like above 200 square feet (i could probably pick one of those singles also, my draw time is just so good hehe, but i think i’d do Dod over them because of the amenities)."], ["March 23, 2017 at 10:01 pm", "I just go an internship at Princeton for this summer.

What specifically does that mean for you?", "Response from Maybach Renntech:\n\nFor me, it means using the very limited resource of time as efficiently as possible. I usually say this is very important because it’s something that made my freshman year very manageable. \n\nAs for specifics, it meant doing things like starting an ECO pset the same day it was assigned. I would try to finish it as if it were due the next day. If there was something I couldn’t do or needed to check, I would go over it with an upperclassmen or TA. I know for a fact people don’t do this because McGraw study halls are empty until the day before a pset is due. Another example is my language class. Instead of watching youtube videos at night or netflix, I would go over conjugations, patterns, etc. Then when I couldn’t go on and needed a break I would finally listen to music or watch youtube… except I would do it in the language I’m trying to learn. When I went to bed (another good trick if you’re having insomnia) I would think about vocabulary or other school related things and it would knock me right out. E.j. repeating formulas continuously in my head.\n\nFor papers, I set goals and always accomplished them like a number of pages I wanted to write or research that needed to get done. For writing seminar, I put a huge amount of effort into drafts, which made revisions a lot easier. It meant doing things like leaving dinner early or not studying with your friends for a night in order to stay focused. Whenever I couldn’t focus, I would work out, which usually helped me get back on track.\n\nI hope some of these examples help to illustrate and if you need more I would be happy to list more. But in summary, time is a valuable resource and whenever I’m not doing something for leisure, it has to be productive. I always look for more ways to use time better. For example, in the middle of last year, I reviewed material for math and econ weeks before midterms on train rides into NYC instead of staring out the window while listening to music. But sometimes, no matter what you do, you can’t  have everything perfectly under control without compromising more important aspects of life. When I took 5 classes, sometimes it meant staying up until 3am in order to finish 3 ten page papers.

I think that if you were to turn down your camp counseling job, and wait (as long as not an unreasonable amount of time) to find out about other internships, you should still be able to get a job as a camp counselor of some kind if everything fell through, though it might not be head counselor and it might not be that specific type of camp or whatever.\n\n\nIf you honestly think that you have a good chance (where this means it is a legitimate possibility it could happen, you wouldn’t have to get struck by lightning or anything, like imo I’d say anything where I could see myself getting it at least 1 in 3 times) of getting one of the internships you applied to, and they are all more attractive to you than the camp job, I would turn down the camp counselor job.

It’s actually more than incredible because I get $11 per class to go to physics (which I would be doing even if I wasn’t getting paid….). 10/10 would recommend both of these jobs, but the note taker thing is kinda luck based on if your classes line up with classes where a notetaker is needed (and if you reply to the email asking for a notetaker fast enough).\n\nI also just got hired as a McGraw Learning Consultant, so I’ll get to start meeting with students in individual consultations to help them study more effectively.

The zee group is also a really nice way to have people to talk to when you first arrive. During frosh week, you’ll really have a ton of time to get to know people, and it becomes very easy to meet a ton of frosh. Like maybe you hang out with your roommate and meet their friend from CA, or you hang out with someone from OA and meet their zee group. From that point on, it’s also easy to meet friends in classes or extracurriculars! There’s a very nice vibe at the beginning of freshman year where people are trying to meet each other.

For example, one of my junior friends was about 2/3 of the way down in draw times last year, and got a fairly decent single in the slums. She said when she chose it, there were still 8 singles left after her. If there are no singles left and your draw group draws into res college housing, you’ll be able to drop to a lower draw time and join a different group, and then draw into a larger room. This is what @ Nick did last year lol. If the situation gets really bad, you can not choose a room and go on the waitlist, but there’s no guarantees as to what your living situation will look like.

I have no idea where to go/ how to cut off/ make new friends/ move on/ fix myself.", "Response from Exupery:\n\nThis is a tough situation, I’m sorry you’re going through this! It’s good you’ve realized your friends are toxic while you still have plenty of time left at Princeton. I think the key here is to surround yourself with new people and to keep yourself busy – sort of like when you’re going through a break-up! You should also try to reach out to as many support systems as you can, for instance your RCA, your CA/OA leader, maybe CPS if you want to just sort of talk it all out with a neutral third-party. \n\nSpecific advice for actually keeping yourself busy and surrounding yourself: try to plan tons of stuff to do with any friends or acquaintances who aren’t in that toxic group. You could invite people to do stuff like seeing shows/performances (there are a lot this time of year!), going or start going to the gym with you, attending study breaks, getting together for a movie night, going to see the USG movies, or even just doing homework together. Assuming the toxic group isn’t part of your zee group, take advantage of all the zee group study breaks and dinners. If you feel awkward asking acquaintances to do stuff, start with getting meals together a little more regularly and then ask them to do stuff with you.\n\n\nYou should also try joining new extracurriculars and maybe dropping old ones if you don’t enjoy them that much and/or if a lot of the toxic friend group is involved. (Obviously don’t rush to quit something you love just because shitty people are there – sit on the decision for a while.) The easiest way to make friends is through DOING something together. If you’re BSE or science-minded, there are a lot of project-based groups looking for members. If you like performing or are open to trying it out, Lobster Club (improv comedy), Acapellago (a capella), and Band (band) all take people with literally 0 experience, no audition. (Like, for real. Band will apparently teach you instruments from scratch, and almost all of LC starts as complete beginners.) I’m sure there’s other stuff out there – would really welcome any suggestions from people reading this!\n\nFinally, as for actually cutting off the toxic friends – I would personally go about through a slow fade. Just respond less or more slowly to texts, stop being active in any group chats, make excuses not to come to events. But I’m also super non-confrontational, and a lot of this would also depend heavily on the context, so I would take my advice on this with a big grain of salt.\n\nBest of luck <3\n\n\nResponse from Pablo:\n\nJust to tack on something small - make sure you’re being honest with yourself and with your friends. For me, this has led to the recovery of friendships that I thought were on the rocks. On the flip-side, not being completely honest has really thwarted some others.

If they aren’t doing that for some reason, then you can look at major topics (e.g., “religion,” “politics,” “warfare,” or whatever) and decide on the themes that you think make sense. Once you have that, you can start going through your notes and readings, fitting each detail (e.g., a particular battle, a person, a piece of artwork, a reading’s main idea, or whatever) into one or more theme(s) and thinking about how it connects to the class as a whole. (This would be the “significance” when you’re doing IDs).

I’m always shocked when I hear people say “oh yeah my dad got me a summer job at Goldman Sachs” or “XYZ Congressman is an old family friend” or whatever because that is literally unfathomable to me.

There are obviously snobby and cliquey people here, as there are at every school, but they are by no means the majority of people. Some of the richest people I know are also the nicest/most down to earth. The main way that I personally notice class differences is in the little ways. Nobody is going to say “oh sorry you’re to poor to hang out with us”, but you can notice class differences in more subtle behaviors. I also think that the social scene can be kind of divided at times, and some of it can be related to class. It’s easier for people who went to high school with a lot of people coming here to meet upperclassmen, get passes, stay in their same social circle, etc. In that sense, class can be a little bit linked to self-selecting social groups for some people, but again, I don’t think that this is something that you wouldn’t see at similar schools (final clubs, secret societies, etc.) and it is very easy to find wealthy people here who are genuinely nice. Income isn’t something that a lot of people talk about that often- like I said, you definitely notice the differences in the little ways.

Most majors here are demanding junior year. MOL has a junior sem in the fall (2 JPs in the fall for that), and then a third JP in the spring. I’m also being expected to come into my new lab about 10 hours per week. Junior year is rough for everyone!\n\nResponse from Princess Mia:\n\nI think it’s one of the more challenging social science majors, but not impossible by any means. The main thing with Woody Woo is that it has a lot of requirements. There are four prereqs, five core classes, four electives, all the junior year stuff, and an extra language requirement. So it does add up to be a lot. I will say that a lot of the requirements are very easy to fulfill. For example, I fulfilled almost all of my electives, prereqs, and a few core classes on accident just by taking classes I was interested in (which is how I’m so far ahead on departmentals). There’s also a huge variety in the classes that you can take to fulfill your departmentals. Most of the core classes have between five and ten options that you can take for each requirement (with the exception of econ), and there’s a list of like 200 electives that you can take. Therefore, I think you can really choose what you’re interested in learning about… it’s very easy to customize your degree to your interests.\n\nAs far as individual classes go, I think the main courses that tend to trip people up are micro and stats. I took ECO 100 in the fall and didn’t like it at all, and will have to take an upper-level micro class at some point. I’m in stats right now, and I actually really really enjoy the class surprisingly haha. I don’t think it’s unreasonable at all (although we will see if my opinion changes post-midterm grades).\n\nI guess my opinion on the major is that it is by no means too hard that you shouldn’t choose it if you’re interested in the major, but it’s probably too intensive to choose if you’re not interested in it at all. I personally probably wouldn’t want to take extra languages or econ if I wasn’t interested in Woody Woo.

Get their “stats,” “what they’re looking for,” exchange pics… If you decide to meet up someone goes to the other person’s room (usually a blunt “want to meet up” or “I’m horny” or “let’s hook up” initiates this phase of the Grindr hookup). You usually engage in awkward small talk for like 15 minutes even though neither person really has any interest in befriending the other guy.

I seriously do not know what to do. How did you guys decide Princeton was the best choice, and why? Thx", "Response from Amygdala:\n\nFirst think about what academics you are interested. If you want to be an engineer for example, Princeton is objectively better. I am sure Harvard is better for other things, idk what they are. Maybe premed/prelaw? \n\nThe most important thing to do is to visit them, get a feel for the campus and talk to students there. Honestly, I think Harvard feels super strange. The campus feels like it has no personality and everyone is pretending to be Harvard students, if that makes any sense? I’ve gone there two or three times with the band and it’s a really bizarre feeling that I don’t experience at any other school. \n\nAlso think about setting, Princeton is decidedly suburban whereas Harvard has very easy access to Boston. Neither is objectively better than the other, just think about where you feel you would be happiest.\n\nUltimately you can’t really make a wrong choice, but I hope this might give you something to think about as you do more research and visit.\n\nResponse from Maybach Renntech:\n\nI remember being in your shoes. Man time flies. But anyways, I got accepted into Brown, Princeton, Cornell, Penn, and Williams. My decision to come to Princeton rested on several factors. First of all the campus and feeling of the student body. I really didn’t want to live directly in a city, I wanted a suburban feeling. I like having a nice, quiet, area, with a small number of people where I I always see someone I know when I go around. I wanted the social scene and activities to be focused on campus. And no absurd fraternity level drinking. Some people (like my friend at Columbia) may think that’s boring and you may be one of them so consider that when choosing. I find that a lot of NYC people don’t like the campus and miss the city. I personally love it, and even when I want the city, it’s only an hour away. Second, Princeton has a very small undergraduate population and an even smaller graduate population. Professors here are really here for the undergrads, we get a lot of attention, and we have very good support for us. I have had lecturers who never got promoted because they care about teaching more than publishing. Harvard on the other hand, has more graduates than undergraduates and you can easily be forgotten. One of my friends at Harvard told me “you really have to put yourself out there” and also that several professors don’t really want to teach undergrads. They just have to as part of their duties as professors. I also really wanted a liberal arts education, which made me turn down Wharton. \n\nNow for some arguments against Princeton in favor of Harvard. First of all the thesis and requirements. Princeton is objectively harder than Harvard and that may affect you decision depending on how much you want inflated grades, your attitude, and your ability to handle anxiety and stress. This shouldn’t be the only factor, but it’s worth saying that it’s probably easier to experience the non-academic rewards of college at Harvard. At Princeton, about 1/3rd of all students say that are overwhelmed academically, socially, emotionally, etc. At Harvard, it’s like 20%. That’s not to say Harvard is a joke. The best way I can sum it up is that at Harvard if you work your hardest in a course you will be rewarded with an A, at Princeton if you work your hardest you can still end up with a B. If you want to come to Princeton, you shouldn’t have an attitude that you’ll still be number 1 in everything, that you need to get all A’s, and you’ll get accepted into most of the clubs you apply for. Princeton takes people down a notch, while Harvard tends to inflate egos further. This leads to another issue which is if you want to go to grad school. I know it may make some people uncomfortable, but Harvard is better if you are pre-med for example. Med-schools like the highest grades possible. Princeton will put you at a disadvantage and you’ll have to work harder to the point of insanity for some people if you want to be in good shape. Of course there are exceptions (like Nick), but they are in the minority and there’s no way to predict how you will fare here as a pre-frosh. \n\nThere’s a reason why our (and UChicago and Columbia) pre-med acceptance rate is so high. It’s because the advisors tell a huge number of prospective pre-meds to not even apply because they have no chance. They get weeded out. As someone who comes from a family of doctors let me also tell you this. Nobody cares where you did you undergraduate degree if you want to be a doctor. Med school, residency, and fellowships are 10 times more important. I can only recommend Princeton to a pre-med if they want that excellent liberal arts experience, they will be able to handle the rigor to get the necessary grades and still have a life, the campus, and because they got a good financial aid package. This is because it makes no sense to pay more money for worse grades. You could go to a good state school, l take it easy and get into a top Med school with good MCAT scores. In this case Harvard is probably less stressful. But there are numerous other things to consider. I just scratched the surface. My advice is to keep talking to real students (NOT TOUR GUIDES) and find both the good and bad and see which matches your preferences the best. As Amygdala said, there’s no wrong choice.\n\nResponse from Nick Carraway:\n\nJust want to add the ‘successful premed perspective.’ Don’t count Princeton out because you’re premed or prelaw. Med schools and law schools know that Princeton is one of the most rigorous institutions in the country. Though our average premed GPA might be slightly lower than that of Harvard’s, our premed acceptance rate is likely almost equivalent. HPA (that’s health professions advising; the advising system for premeds here) publishes statistics on the average GPAs of Princeton students that get accepted into all the top medical schools each year. Take Harvard med, for example (highly-ranked, consistently top 3). The average GPA of all students accepted to Harvard med is a 3.94. When you look at the average GPA of Princeton students accepted to Harvard med in the past 5 years, it’s a 3.83. This is the case for all of the top med schools. I agree, this place is hard as hell. But if you apply yourself and are serious about the premed path, you can be more than successful here. I don’t know if I agree with the above assertion that all the premeds get ‘weeded out.’ Is this not the case at every school in classes like orgo and biochem? Most of the premeds I know here are succeeding, even if they’re not hitting a 4.0."], ["March 16, 2017 at 1:34 am", "Amygdala, what have you found to be the differences between Charter and Quad?

I’m sure you can also meet gay guys in your classes and clubs or at places like the LGBT Center. A lot of people also use apps like Tinder and Grindr. \n\nResponse from Nick Carraway:\n\nLol I love that Mia answered this!

Tons of gay guys on campus haven’t really dated before, so you’re definitely not in the minority there or anything.\n\nI agree completely with what Mia said.

Additionally, different students and student groups will sometimes sponsor shows. Other groups to check out- Princeton Shakespeare Company, Quipfire!/Fuzzy Dice/Lobster Club (improv comedy), and L’avant-scène (French theatre).

There will probably be some readings or smaller writing assignments in between, although the papers, especially the Rs, are by far the most important.

For reference, I got similar grades in all three introductory classes, but I’ve gotten some form of A in almost all of my upper-level departmentals and independent work stuff. It takes some of us more time than others to learn how to be a good computer science student and to think in the way that CS requires. You should evaluate what caused those grades, but also how much you’ve grown and learned over the past two courses (and whether you think you can keep an upward trajectory going). You should also talk to your preceptor or whomever knows you best from these courses – they see so many kids, and they probably have a pretty decent gauge of what you’ll be able to handle. I think that there’s also a departmental representative (?) who is meant for pre-majors?

I'm an incoming freshman for next year, planning on doing engineering (probably electrical or comp sci).

I'm currently taking AP Calc BC and physics C so I'm going to take the tests. Pretty much, my question is: do a lot of BSE students place out of these classes? is it beneficial? if they do place out of them, do they succeed or is it best to take them at Princeton?", "Response from Bateman:\n\nPlace out of anything you’re able to, especially as an engineer. Most BSE students use placement for math, but physics is much less common. You’ll have a lot more freedom in terms of scheduling your freshman year, which is great. \n\nResponse from Pichu: Place out of as much as you can. Especially physics, it has class like everyday and is super annoying and is not useful for most BSE majors, so try your best for a 5 on the ap tests"], ["March 13, 2017 at 3:16 pm", "How do you become an RTP contributor?", "Response from Maybach Renntech:\n\nAmygdala (the site administrator) will post that we are in need of more contributors.
