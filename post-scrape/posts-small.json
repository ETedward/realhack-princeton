Although this doesn\u2019t mean you should not take your classes seriously, but the goal is ultimately to put forward the most compelling app you can. For everyone out there, my recommendation would be to just do your best GPA-wise and LSAT-wise, be involved in the community, and make sure to build strong relationships with professors.

Remember its not like a interview for a job or anything, you\u2019re talking to other college kids probably your age who just want good people in their club to eat meals with and stuff. So putting on a show/ trying to be someone you\u2019re not is probably not the best option because ppl can see right through it. For cap specifically you can search bar for details (cap bicker nick) but I know there bicker involves games and activities, so try to be \u201cfun and outgoing\u201d but also not dominate conversations or rub people the wrong way. That kind of goes for any club, if you\u2019re bickering somewhere where you don\u2019t know a ton of people, you want to have memorable conversations so people remember you. I also would ask members you know in the club specifically about the bicker process and cap itself, they\u2019ll probably be more than happy to tell you.\n\nBut also going off that, bicker is decided by a bunch of college kids who really don\u2019t know anything about you in the long run so don\u2019t take anything that happens (good or bad) to heart.\u00a0\n\nResponse from Kronk:\n\nYup, agreed with all of the above - being yourself and trying to be friendly are the key pieces of advice imo. For cap specifically, I know other members like it when someone bickering genuinely shows or has shown interest in the club, whether that\u2019s through coming to pre-bicker events (coming soon, I believe), coming to nights out, or just having a really good why cap? answer. The key word in that sentence is genuine. If you\u2019re a soph and already have friends in the club to ask questions to, then great; if not, then definitely come to events and talk to members and ask questions too.\n\nCap bicker is a mixture of games and conversations, mostly leaning towards games. A lot of members get really reallly into designing their games and trying to make it fun and just get super bummed when a bickeree doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re into it/not participating. Nothing is designed or allowed to be uncomfortable and if something does make you uncomfortable, you should report it to an officer immediately, but for the most part, a lot of members are trying to see if you can let loose a little and enjoy yourself. That being said, Katara is right in that you shouldn\u2019t overdo it and be the only person in the circle talking the entire time. Another thing is that a lot of games or conversations will involve asking bickerees to tell us a story or something interesting about themselves, and some people unfortunately come up with some pretty inappropriate things that don\u2019t sit well with a large audience, so just be mindful of that too.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, bicker is a process in which a small group of people get to talk to you for an average of <7 minutes each in an unnatural environment for a cumulative total of less than a few hours.

There is a good amount of overlap between BSE and EEB prereqs - you have to take chem for both, you have to take physics for both, and you have already knocked out the EEB math requirement with your calc AP. This means that if you do CEE for a semester or two and then decide that you want to go back to EEB, you really only have to squeeze in those two intro EEB classes (or one if you have AP bio credit) and a stats class before junior fall, which is doable. You still have time to explore and solidify your interests, but start tackling those BSE classes if there is a real possibility of you ending up with CEE. Also, for your last question, you could always take a math placement test - there are probably students who place straight into linear algebra every year, but I will say that the majority of people who come into Princeton with a background in multivariable calculus still take MAT 201/203 anyway, because those classes go into more depth than most high schools do.

You start off by singing some scales to warm up your voice and give some indication of your vocal range. Then, they will ask you to do some pitch-matching exercises (they play a series of notes and you sing them back), pitch-finding exercises (they play a series of chords and ask you to sing back the top, middle, or bottom note), and maybe some swells (you sing a note as softly and as loudly as you can). There may be a couple of groups that will also give you sheet music and test your sight-singing ability, but that is not super common. Finally, you get a chance to perform your prepared piece - one verse and chorus of one song should be enough. And then you are done! If you get a callback, they usually teach you songs during that process, so there is really no need for you to prepare more than one song beforehand, but I also do not see how it would hurt to have multiple songs up your sleeve. One time, I got too sick to hit the high notes of my prepared song on the day of a musical audition, so I walked into the room and sang an alto-range piece instead, because I also happened to know it well.

I definitely want to get my STL over with in the spring, but there are three classes in my major I also want to take. That would leave me with three more distribution requirements to complete before graduation. No need to take a five class semester in order to rush to finish the distributions right?", "Response from Scarlett O\u2019Hara:\n\nYou\u2019ll be fine just knocking out one dist next semester. Definitely no need to rush, three distributions left after sophomore year is totally fine; you can just take one dist a semester as a fun/easier break from your major classes.\u00a0"], ["November 9, 2018 at 7:29 am", "You don't need 217 for COS 426; no one will check.

The reasonable time frame really depends on what kind of club this is, what your position is, and what your responsibilities are.

I always tell myself to pdf if I get under a certain score, but once pdf starts I start telling myself not to pdf... because I don't want the work I've done to go to waste, getting a P still seems pretty stressful (I would put the same effort into it to make sure I get the P), the possibility of raising my gpa if I'm lucky is enticing. But if I don't pdf, I end up getting an OK grade that lowers my gpa anyway. I would appreciate some advice :(", "Response from Scarlett O\u2019Hara:\n\nThis has been in the inbox for a little while, so I guess we\u2019re all a little unsure of what to advise.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince you\u2019ve already seen that not pdfing a class after contemplating it only gets you an ok grade that lowers your gpa, I think you\u2019ve proven to yourself to trust in your first pdf-instinct and not second-guess. Since this is a recurring problem for you, you might need to change strategies to avoid this problem in the future: maybe select courses based on whether or not you\u2019ll pdf, instead of debating whether to pdf while you\u2019re taking it, start the course with the mindset of your course of action. That way you\u2019re not starting off dedicating so much time that you feel guilty\u00a0\u201cletting the work go to waste\u201d but you can still be conscious of your efforts to get a P. You definitely should not put the same amount of effort in to get an A as to get a P; if you really think a class requires equal effort to get an A as to get a C, then you\u2019re pdfing the wrong class lol. You\u2019ve gotta practice some tough love and really be honest with yourself about how well you think you can perform in a class. I would be more upset with myself for lowering my gpa again than for missing out on the possibility of raising my gpa tbh, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\u00a0"]]
